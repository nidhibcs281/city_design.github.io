# Course Overview: Natural Patterns and Real-World Problem Solving

This course explores the application of natural patterns and designs to solve real-world problems using data structures and algorithms. It highlights that algorithms are not just theoretical concepts but practical strategies used in everyday life.

These algorithms help organize data, find the shortest path, and make decisions based on past information. The course connects the learning to real-time applications, demonstrating that algorithms are not just theoretical concepts but are rooted in our thinking and actions in the real world. By understanding the connection between these time-tested methods and their application in the modern world, students can better understand the world around them.
